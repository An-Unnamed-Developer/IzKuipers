### Hi there 👋

Glad you found my github profile! I do actually wonder how you ended up here, was it because of ArcOS, NetCMD, or maybe another repository? TWIx86 perhaps? Well actually it doesn't matter, because you are here now. Welcome!

* I've been working on ArcOS since February, with little other projects rolling in here and there, like as I described NetCMD, my terminal in Electron, and TWIx86, my OS made in C# with the COSMOS kernel.

I hope you like what you see and feel free to give feedback on my repositories!
