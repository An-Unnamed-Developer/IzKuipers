### Hi there üëã

Glad you found my github profile! I do actually wonder how you ended up here, was it because of ArcOS, nTerm, or maybe another repository? TWIx86 perhaps? Well actually it doesn't matter, because you are here now. Welcome!

My name is Izaak Kuipers, a 15 year old fullstack developer focussed soully on making programs accessible to the public for IT hobbyists and the like. I've been on GitHub since december 2020 and have almost a houndred total repositories. I hope to make a lot of them public in the near future but that is still up for consideration.

Want to contact me? go ahead, [here's my email](mailto:me@twihub.tk)

Oh, I'm on discord too of course: Izaak#4599

Anyway, below you can find some of my bigger projects, most of them still have an active development cycle, but some of them have been discontinued.

#### What am I working on?
* ArcOS is currently going through a rewrite/refactor of the entire codebase
* TWIx86 development has stopped since the last profile update
* TWILang-Test is a repository where I'm writing my own programming language (private as of june 8th 2022)
* nTerm development was restarted with a svelte rewrite but it has come to a pause. You can always look at the current running build [here](https://www.techworldinc.tk/nTerm).
* My private server called the Cortex where I store music, movies and files.
