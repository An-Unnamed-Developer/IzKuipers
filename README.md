# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Izaak Kuipers, a 16 year old fullstack developer focussed solely on making programs accessible to the public for IT hobbyists and the like. I've been on GitHub since december 2020 and have nearly 200 repositories. I specialize in frontend development using TS, CSS and Svelte, and some backend API's using TS and NodeJS. I also have a lot of experience creating API's and other applications using C#.

> 🎉 The ArcOS Desktop app is now stable! [Take a look](https://izk-arcos.github.io/)!

## What am I working on? ⚒️

🔐 = Private or not on GitHub<br/>
🔓 = Public or Public Archive

The following projects are in active development:

- 🔓 ArcOS is being rewritten from the ground up: [take a look](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS)
- 🔐 SchoolSystem is a project in which students of my school can manage their homework
- 🔐 The Reggistry is an egg-management-system (yes, that's a thing) in which my household keeps track of how many eggs the chickens lay on a daily basis
- 🔐 My Cortex server infrastructure is currently undergoing a redo of the internal structure

Finally, these projects are discontinued or halted:

- 🔐 My discord bot is halted because of other things that took priority
- 🔓 TWIx86 is still dead and is likely permanently discontinued.
- 🔓 TWILang-Test was the first implementation of my own programming language but is no longer in development.
- 🔓 nTerm got some refactoring in november 2022 in the original Vite-TS codebase but got halted since: [here's the code](https://github.com/IzKuipers/nTerm)
- 🔓 vTDx is my note taking WebApp, which also got halted because of other things that took priority: [vTDx organization](https://github.com/vTDx)
